Option A

1. Hyginus’ word choice of *insula* enhances the meaning of section 8's passage content because it portrays Hercules as an even bigger hero. 
Hyginus does this by showing that Hercules wasn't only known in the part of the land that we have been talking about, but he also made himself known on the island of Mycenae. 
Hercules wasn't only a hero in that section of land, but also out of it. 

2. Hyginus’ word order *adbero famulo interfecit* enhances the meaning of passage 9's content because it is showing the importance of the horses compared to the slave.
In the sentence the slave is placed at the end making him/her an after thought.
The death of the slave wasn't as imporatnt. This shows how slaves were not seen as humans and how even animals were seen as more important than them.
