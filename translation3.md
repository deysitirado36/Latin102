**A. Grammatical analysis

Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.

maiorem partem 

> Iove adiutore;

> flumine *admisso*

totum stercus *abluit.*

**B. Grammatical questions

1 - In the phrase, Iove adiutore, what case is Iove? What kind of construction is this phrase?

- Iove is in the ablative case. This is an ablative ablsolute construction.

2 - What case is stercus, and why is it in that case?

- Accusative because it is what was cleaned from the stable.

3 - Identify the form of the adjective maiorem (gender, case, number, degree).

- Masculine, accusative, singular, comparative ❌ **The form *maiorem* could be masculine, but what word does it modify in this sentence?**

4 - Explain the construction of the verbal unit flumine admisso.

- This is an ablative ablsolute construction. Flumine is the ablative of flumen, fluminis (n) and admisso is the ablative of admissus/a/um. Flumine serves as the ablative sub while admisso serves as the ablative predicate. 

5 - What are the gender, number, case, and antecedent of qui?

- Masculine, plural, nominative, horses

6 - What Latin verb form has to be understood in the clause that runs from equorum to Dinus?

- No visible verb. The invisible erant. 

**C. Literary commentary

Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. Discuss briefly in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

- When Hyginus decided to use the relative clause *"qui carne humana vescebantur"* they enhanced the meaning of the passage's context. This is important because it shows how Hercules is a "superior" human being. He killed horses who eat humans. 

- When Hyginus made *"taurum"* accusative and didn't mention Hercules as the subject also enhanced the meaning of the passage. Becuase it is implied that Hercules is the subject shows that Hercules's name doesnt need to be mentioned anymore because it would be too repetative. This shows that Hercules has done so many tasks that it is pointless to keep mentioning his name because we should already know it.

**D. Translation

7. He cleaned the dung from the stable of King Augeas in one day, a greater part while Juppiter was helping; by letting in a river he washed away all the dung. 

8. He brought the bull with whom Pasiphae lay with alive from the island in Cerete to Mycenae.

9. He killed Diomedes, King of Thrace, and his four horses, which fed on human flesh, along with the slave Abderus; the horses' names were Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus, and Dinus.
