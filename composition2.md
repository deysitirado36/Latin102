Your first sentence should use a negative purpose clause to say that when Deianira, the daughter of Oeneus and the wife of Hercules saw that the beautiful young girl Iole had been brought (to her house), she began to devise a plot in order not to lose her husband (or “be deprived of” her husband).

> Cum Deianira, filia Oenei et uxor Herculi vidisset 

>> pulchram iuvenem puellam Iolen adductam esse,

coepit machinari

> ne privaretur suo marito.

Your second sentence should express that she sent her servant to bring to Hercules a garment dipped in the blood of the centaur Nessus, which she thought was a love potion.

Ea suum famulum misit

> ad adducendum vestem tinctum sanguine centauri Nessi Herculi,

>> quem putabat philtrum esse.

Your third sentence should say that Hercules put the garment on and it immediately burst into flames.

> Indutus ab Hercule

statim flammabat.

Your fourth sentence should express that Hercules threw the slave, whom Deianira had sent to bring the garment back, into the sea.

Hercules threw the slave,

> quem Deianira misit ad vestem ferendum,

in mare.

Your last sentence should express that it is reported (or said) that Hercules rose to immortality, but Deianira killed herself on account of this deed.

Dicitur Herculem ad immortalitatam estortum esse,

> Deianira se interfecit.
