**Needs minor revisions**
**Nice draft!**

Your first sentence should use a negative purpose clause to say that when Deianira, the daughter of Oeneus and the wife of Hercules saw that the beautiful young girl Iole had been brought (to her house), she began to devise a plot in order not to lose her husband (or “be deprived of” her husband).

> Cum Deianira, filia Oenei et uxor Herculi vidisset 

>> pulchram iuvenem puellam Iolen adductam esse,

coepit machinari

> ne privaretur suus❌**What does this agree with?** marito.

Your second sentence should express that she sent her servant to bring to Hercules a garment dipped in the blood of the centaur Nessus, which she thought was a love potion.

Ea suus famulum misit

> ad adductndum❌ **Check form** vestem tinctus est❌**Just use the particle, not a clause** sanguine centauri Nessi Herculi,

>> quem congitabat❌  amorem potionem. **Let's check some vocab options for this phrase>

Your third sentence should say that Hercules put the garment on and it immediately burst into flames.

> Hercules induentem❌

statim flammbat.❌ **Careful with the form**

Your fourth sentence should express that Hercules threw the slave, whom Deianira had sent to bring the garment back, into the sea.

Hercules threw the slave,

> quem Deianira misit ❌**Need a purpose experssion** reddidisse vestimentum,

in mare.

Your last sentence should express that it is reported (or said) that Hercules rose to immortality, but Deianira killed herself on account of this deed.

Dictus est quia❌ Herculem estortum esse,

> Deianira interfecit suam❌.
