Heracles travelled to the city of Oechalia in Aetolia, and asked the king, Eurytus, for permission to marry his daughter, Iole. When Eurytus refused, Heracles not only destroyed the city, but killed Iole’s parents before her very eyes. He then took Iole captive, and sent her to his home, to his wife Deianira (!)


Your first sentence should use a temporal clause to express that when Hercules came to Oechalia, he asked to marry Iole.
> Cum Hercules Oechalia veniisset, Iolen uxorem petivit.

Your second sentence should state that when her father Eurytus was unwilling, Hercules captured Oechalia.
> Cum Eurytus, pater eius, nouisset, Hercules Oechaliam cepit.

Your third sentence should express that Hercules said that he would kill her parents, and should include an indirect statement.
> Hercules dixit interficere ea 

Your fourth sentence should say that Iole endured that her parents were killed.
> 

Your fifth statement should say that when he had killed all of them, he sent Iole to Deianira.
>
