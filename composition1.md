Your first sentence should use a temporal clause to express that when Hercules came to Oechalia, he asked to marry Iole.

> Cum Hercules Oechaliam veniisset, Iolen uxorem petivit.

Your second sentence should state that when her father Eurytus was unwilling, Hercules captured Oechalia.
> Cum Eurytus, pater eius, nollet, Hercules Oechaliam cepit.

Your third sentence should express that Hercules said that he would kill her parents, and should include an indirect statement.
> Herculem dixit se eius parentes interfecturum esse.

Your fourth sentence should say that Iole endured that her parents were killed.
> Iolen patiebatur suos parentes interfectos esse.

Your fifth statement should say that when he had killed all of them, he sent Iole to Deianira.
> Quia Is omnes eos interfecit, Iolen ad Deianiram misit.
